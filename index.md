  e.g., '2015-06-10-esu'.

{% comment %}
  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

  SETUP

  Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
  section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
  and end easier to find.

  you will need access to the software described below.
  In addition, you will need an up-to-date web browser.
</p>
<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the

The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful,
so this introduction to Python is built around a common scientific task:
**data analysis**.

### Arthritis Inflammation
We are studying **inflammation in patients** who have been given a new treatment for arthritis, and
need to analyze the first dozen data sets of their daily inflammation. The data sets are stored in
[comma-separated values]({{ page.root }}/reference/#comma-separated-values) (CSV) format:

- each row holds information for a single patient,
- columns represent successive days.

The first three rows of our first file look like this:
~~~
0,0,1,3,1,2,4,7,8,3,3,3,10,5,7,4,7,7,12,18,6,13,11,11,7,7,4,6,8,8,4,4,5,7,3,4,2,3,0,0
0,1,2,1,2,1,3,2,2,6,10,11,5,9,4,4,7,16,8,6,18,4,12,5,12,7,11,5,11,3,3,5,4,4,5,5,1,1,0,1
0,1,1,3,3,2,6,2,5,9,5,7,4,5,4,15,5,11,9,10,19,14,12,17,7,12,11,7,4,2,10,5,4,2,2,3,2,2,1,1
~~~
{: .source}

So, we want to:

1. Calculate the average inflammation per day across all patients.
2. Plot the result to discuss and share with colleagues.

To do all that, we'll have to learn a little bit about programming.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> You need to understand the concepts of **files** and **directories** and how to start a Python
> interpreter before tackling this lesson. This lesson sometimes references Jupyter
> Notebook although you can use any Python interpreter mentioned in the [Setup](setup/).
>
> The commands in this lesson pertain to **Python 3**.

### Getting Started
To get started, follow the directions on the "[Setup](setup/)" page to download data
and install a Python interpreter.
